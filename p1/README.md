## Game planning
Lottery? Powerball!
- Jackpot is x million dollars.
- Odds
- Cost of one ticket is $2 for player
    - How many tickets do you want?
- Player spent $x, won $x.
- Select five numbers from 1 to 69 for the white balls; then select one number from 1 to 26 for the red
        Powerball. Choose your numbers on a play slip or let the lottery terminal randomly pick your numbers. The
        Powerball jackpot grows until it is won.
- Randomly generate 5 numbers from 1 to 69, 1 for PowerBall from 1 to 26.
    - Each number must be greater than the previous number.
    - If the player's number is === to the 5 numbers, and === to powerball = Jackpot!
    - 5 matching numbers, Prize = $1,000,000 (Powerplay $2mill)
    - 4 matching number + powerball = $50,0000( x powerplays)
    - 4 matching - $100 (x powerplays)
    - 3 matching number + powerball = $100 (x powerplay)
    - 3 matching numbers = $7 (x powerplay)
    - 2 matching numbers + powerball = $7 (x powerplay)
    - 1 matching number + powerball = $4 (x powerplay)
    - 0 matching number + powerball = $4 (x powerplay)
- Add Multiplier randomly add a power play, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 10x, cost of each is multiplier is $1?
